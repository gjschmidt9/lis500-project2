            <h3> Gabe Schmidt</h3>
            <p>My name is Gabe. I am a senior studying Information Science. I took this class partially because it is a core class for the Information Science major but also because I thought this would be an interesting to see how code can be related to power and what it can do to people, whether it be in the past or recent history.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>My favorite tech thing I have is my Apple Watch. I initially wan't going to buy one but slowly I found some reasons as to why I could use one and in the end I absolutely love having it!</p>
