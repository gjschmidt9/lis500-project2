          <p>This page talks about implicit bias, intersectionality, and the Implicit Bias Test (IBT). Each section includes definitions, videos about the topic as well as an article for the aspect to describe the term.</p>
          <!--To be able to just use the topic discussed from Project #1 made it relatively straight forward to know what to write on this page-->

          <!--Some assistance was used from AI to understand the best way to layer this area because I wanted it to both be numbered for the overarching term and have bulletpoints for information or links and I didn't exactly know how to approach this task-->

                <strong>Implicit Bias</strong>
                
              <!--Using the bolding function instead of putting a header made this section look better as there was no trial and error of trying to match a certain heading to the style of the page-->
              
                <ul>
                <li>Definition of implicit bias: Implicit bias, also known as implicit prejudice or implicit attitude, is a negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group. Implicit bias is thought to be shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender. Individuals’ perceptions and behaviors can be influenced by the implicit biases they hold, even if they are unaware they hold such biases. Implicit bias is an aspect of implicit social cognition: the phenomenon that perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes can operate prior to conscious intention or endorsement (American Psychological Association).</li>

            <li>
              <strong>Intersectionality</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Definition of intersectionality: Intersectionality is the way to understand and analyze things such as human experiences, people and the world in general, often shaped by many complex and social-structural inequality factors. Its not all the same for one person and can be used for much more than just describing one's self.</li>

              <strong>Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Description: The IBT is a tool developed by researchers to measure the strength of automatic associations between concepts (e.g., race, gender) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad).</li>
                <li>From Gabe: Personally I thought the Implicit Bias test was a little ridiculous in the way it was done because while some words are pretty easy to match with others, there are some that generally dont make much sense as certain words could be associated with other. Especially the hispanic one as nationalities and last names were something I needed to "sort" however some last names can be interchangable for any person. And then when the words switched places then it became difficult as my brain wanted to press the button to where it was originally was, except by this point it was swapped</li>

          <!--Keeping the <ol> tags away from the rest of the blocks was a style choice to ensure when coding I didn't accidentally remove the tag if something either went wrong or there was a type I needed to fix-->
