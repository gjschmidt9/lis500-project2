            <!--The choice of having the width being 200 was to ensure the image wasn't too large but also wasn't so small that you couldn't see it-->
            <!--The choice to have the sizing here instead of the CSS page was to ensure that the code would run without issues-->
            
            <p>Less of a hero and more of an entrepreneur with an interesting vision. Palmer Luckey, founder of Anduril Industries and designer of the Oculus Rift and Oculus VR, is transforming the defense capabilities of the United States and its allies by fusing artificial intelligence with the latest hardware advancements. Anduril Industries founded in 2017 is integrating a consumer technology business model with mission-driven objectives, enabling rapid product development and deployment, setting the company apart from other players in the defense industry.</p>

            <p>His interest in defense technology was found from his time spent at the USC ICT MxR lab, where he built hardware that was then used to research immersive PTSD treatment for US veterans. His support for the use and application of VR continued during his time at Oculus, forming his belief that radical modernization of US military technology is imperative for the preservation of life.</p>

            <p>When asked who my tech hero was, I initially couldn't think of anyone. However, when I learned of Ciara Imani May's innovations in beauty and haircare, she quickly became my choice. Ciara Imani May is the founder of the first US-based plant-based braiding hair company. Typical braiding hair is made of a variety of synthetic materials that could irritate the scalp.</p>
