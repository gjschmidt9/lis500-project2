              <strong>Implicit Bias</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Definition of implicit bias: Implicit bias, also known as implicit prejudice or implicit attitude, is a negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group. Implicit bias is thought to be shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender. Individualsâ€™ perceptions and behaviors can be influenced by the implicit biases they hold, even if they are unaware they hold such biases. Implicit bias is an aspect of implicit social cognition: the phenomenon that perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes can operate prior to conscious intention or endorsement (American Psychological Association).</li>

              <strong>Intersectionality</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Definition of intersectionality: Intersectionality is the way to understand and analyze things such as human experiences, people and the world in general, often shaped by many complex and social-structural inequality factors. Its not all the same for one person and can be used for much more than just describing one's self.</li>

              <strong>Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Description: The IBT is a tool developed by researchers to measure the strength of automatic associations between concepts (e.g., race, gender) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad).</li>
