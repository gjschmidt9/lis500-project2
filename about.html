                    <h3> Gabe Schmidt</h3>
                    <p>My name is Gabe. I am a senior studying Information Science. I took this class partially because it is a core class for the Information Science major but also because I thought this would be an interesting to see how code can be related to power and what it can do to people, whether it be in the past or recent history.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>My favorite tech thing I have is my Apple Watch. I initially wan't going to buy one but slowly I found some reasons as to why I could use one and in the end I absolutely love having it!</p>

            <!--I didn't really have much of a creative name for the about us page so I thought it would be better to just have the general "About us" title as most website have-->
            <!--h3 was chosen for the heading as h2 originally seemed too close in size to h1 and I wanted there to be more of a difference visually when you see it-->
            <!--Using <p></p> as a spacing method may look a little messy but I think its the best way to add space between text or titles as its not too big and not too small of a space to be in-->
            <!--The spaces between everyone's name is just to give us each our own block to write how we want to-->

                    <h3>Braxton</h3>
                    <p>My name is Braxton, and I am a distant student in the iSchool. I enrolled in this class because I was curious about how tech and race could potentially intersect.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>My favorite tech gadget has to be my iPad. I was hesitant to buy one because of my allegiance to my laptop, but it has changed the way I do school. My favorite app is CollaNote, which is a note-taking app.</p>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Andy and I am a senior majoring in Information Science. I took this class because it is a core class and its online! Plus it doesn't hurt to learn more about coding and its history.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>My favorite tech thing I have is my Apple Watch. It was gifted to me by my girlfriend and ever since then, I love using it to track how long it's going to take for me to get to class. I wasn't going to mention it cause I had lost it for over 5 months but it was finally found!</p>
