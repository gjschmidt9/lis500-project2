            <h2>Some interesting projects that I've been a part of in recent years</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>I investigated the hourly performance of tellers at all locations to ensure optimal customer service as well as implemented new web tracking tools setting the foundation to monetize actions performed on web sites and gathered and organized call center data to identify data insights to optimized customer phone workflows at my past internship with Park State Bank</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>I was a part of many different sport complexes, convention center/business hotel and event center proposals for many locations across the US. Some included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A proposal for a new convention center with a large onsite hotel for Columbia, MO, for large events</li>
                <li>A potential new ice arena for Beloit, WI for both their youth hockey program and Beloit college</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This was an internship for <strong>CSL International</strong></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I also created a website prototype for my LIS 351 class on GitHub</p>
